## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository!

I'm a backend developer with a focus on building secure, efficient, and well-structured RESTful APIs using Java, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL. Iâ€™m passionate about writing clean, scalable server-side code that powers modern web and mobile applications.

My primary tech stack revolves around Java and the Spring ecosystem, which I use to design modular, testable, and high-performance backend services. With Spring Boot, I aim to streamline development while maintaining flexibility, security, and adherence to best practices. From setting up layered architectures to implementing robust authentication and authorization systems, I focus on creating APIs that are both developer-friendly and production-ready.

PostgreSQL is my go-to choice for data persistence. I take care to design normalized, efficient schemas and use advanced querying and indexing techniques to ensure performance and reliability. I also incorporate tools like JPA and Hibernate to manage data access while keeping control over performance-critical operations.

This repository is a collection of my projects, ranging from practice builds and API experiments to complete backend services. Each project reflects my ongoing effort to improve as a developer by exploring different patterns, integrating new tools, and focusing on clean code principles.

Whether you're looking for sample Spring Boot APIs, ideas for structuring a backend project, or just exploring for learning purposes, I hope you find something useful here. Iâ€™m always open to feedback, contributions, and discussion, as collaboration and community are essential parts of the development process.

Thanks for checking out my workâ€”feel free to explore, fork, or contribute to any project that interests you!
